<h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>

1. Copy both files to a Folder

2. Open teminal in "THE Folder"

3. Run hidden-directories.py file in kali teminal <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;command:&emsp;&emsp;"python3 hidden-directories.py"

4. Enter url, and Common Directories File Name (ie, common.txt)

6. The code runs and gives you all the directories which matched the common directories in the given file.

7. Generally, we can find the common.txt at "/usr/share/derb/wordlists/" in kali linux

8. After getting the output, now we can deep dive into the sub-directories of that website

8. For example, we got directory1, directory2, and directory3 in "abc.com" <br>
now we can run the code again and give "abc.com/directory1" instead of "abc.com" in the url input field to explore directory1
